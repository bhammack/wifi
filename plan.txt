Components this project will require:
  1.  Airmon-ng, or some kind of other wifi scanning utility. Preferably with API bindings.
    - Or it seems I can use ioctl. Read the link below...

  2.  GPS module. Necessary to get the current position.
    - The "gpsd" daemon seems to be the UNIX de-facto standard for GPS communication.

  3.  SQL instance. Will likely use sqlite3, cause it's just fantastic.

  4.  Webserver. Not necessary, but useful for hosting a custom google maps, showing locations.
    - I've done this before with the bustracker program (or was it Leaflet.js?). Either way...

  5.  Calculator program. Something to translate the data points we collect to estimated coordaintes.
