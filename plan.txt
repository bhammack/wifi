Components this project will require:
	1. Airmon-ng, or some kind of other wifi scanning utility. Preferably with API bindings.
		- Or it seems I can use ioctl. Read the link below...

		* https://github.com/thodg/wifi/blob/master/libwifi/scan.c
	
	There aren't any bindings for airodump-ng (the classic 80211 packet sniffer).
	However, the application itself is written in C. This could be useful.
	The IOctl link only works on an already-connected interface. Not what I'm looking for.
	Wifite is a pythonic automater for aircrack-ng. It wraps the airodump process. 
	I'd rather not just "wrap" airodump. Too easy to do.

	2. GPS module. Necessary to get the current position.
		- The "gpsd" daemon seems to be the UNIX de-facto standard for GPS communication. 
		* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gpsd
		- THE DEVICE IN USE FOR GPS IS /dev/ttyUSB0!!!!!
		> sudo apt-get install gpsd, gpsd-clients, python-gps, libgps-dev

		* http://www.catb.org/gpsd/client-howto.html
		* https://fossies.org/dox/gpsd-3.16/gps_8h_source.html
	
	3. SQL instance. Will likely use sqlite3, cause it's just fantastic.
		* https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_c_cpp.htm
		> sudo apt-get install sqlite3, libsqlite3-dev
 
	4. Webserver. Not necessary, but useful for hosting a custom google maps, showing locations.
		- This will be done by hosting the server on wlan1, the extra raspberry pi interface!
		* http://elinux.org/RPI-Wireless-Hotspot
  
	5. Determining the hotspot locations.
		* http://www.geo.mtu.edu/UPSeis/locating.html
		- NOTE: This can work, HOWEVER, signal-noise ratio is LOGRITHMIC, NOT LINEAR!!!
		- Is there a way I can convert S:N to a linear magnitude of signal strength?	
	
Progress:
	1. Completed. Using IOctl to communicate with the wifi driver. I have developed a C++ wrapper;
	to interface with the IOctl command via iwlib. It returns a stream of wifi events captured from
	the receiver, which need be parsed for specific data. This is a fairly pedantic process, so I've
	also written a Builder class that assembles access points from the iwevent data stream.
	
	2. Completed. I have purchased a GPS usb receiver from amazon.com to use with this project. Using
	the GPSD daemon and the libgps-dev (C wrappings to the GPSD daemon), I can poll for data from the
	receiver device. 
	
	3. In progress. I am currently debating whether I should use a database schema such as SQLite, or
	just dump the raw data into a flat file. The primary reason I chose a database to begin with is because
	there will be substantial duplication of data in a flat csv file format. For instance, I only need one
	instance of the mac address :: ssid relationship. However, flat files will allow me to remove the
	dependency on SQLite, which is advantageous for creating an expanding codebase. Or, heh, I could just
	implement both, and see which one I like best. I'll likely go this approach.
