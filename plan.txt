Components this project will require:
  1.  Airmon-ng, or some kind of other wifi scanning utility. Preferably with API bindings.
  2.  GPS module. Necessary to get the current position.
  3.  SQL instance. Will likely use sqlite3, cause it's just fantastic.
  4.  Webserver. Not necessary, but useful for hosting a custom google maps, showing locations.
  5.  Calculator program. Something to translate the data points we collect to estimated coordaintes.
